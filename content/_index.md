  Our goal is to create a community for IT experts and enthusiasts who specialize in the relevant topics on the always evolving IT area.

  Our mission is to have a place to share knowledge, learn from each other and meet and mingle!

  Our vision is to share ideas, have others pickup those ideas, reflect on them, improve them, and at their turn share the improved ideas. Resulting in a win-win for both the original idea owner and the improved idea owner as they both learn from each other!

  Currently we have the following members who share their experience and knowledge via personal blogs, give us a ping if you would like contribute in a similar or any other way.
